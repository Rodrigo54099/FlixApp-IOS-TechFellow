### Notes
Overall, creating the Flix app was very insightful to me because it showed me how to use API's with swift. They video walk throughs were very helpful I felt good knowing that even though I did not understand the puspose behind some of the syntax, I was able to walk away with a better understanding of API's as a whole.
