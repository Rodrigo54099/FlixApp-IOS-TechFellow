### Notes
Overall, part 2 of this flix assignment was very insightful for me in the sesne that I was able to experiment with new features in XCode(collection views, collection view cells) and gain more practive with features I used in the first part of the assignment(table view, table view cells). I did not stumble into any major challenge I could not solve my reweatching a section of the guiding demonstation videos or by conducutiing my own searches online. Even through most of the application was buult with the help of our guided demonstration videos, I feel like I have been able to take away so much and that has allowed me to feel more confident towards learning iOS mobile devleopment

### Notes
Overall, creating the Flix app was very insightful to me because it showed me how to use API's with swift. They video walk throughs were very helpful I felt good knowing that even though I did not understand the puspose behind some of the syntax, I was able to walk away with a better understanding of API's as a whole.
